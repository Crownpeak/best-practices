## [Fredhopper & Salesforce Commerce Cloud Reference Architecture](../README.md)

# Architectural Principles
This section outlines the fundamental architectural principles for integrating Fredhopper with Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC). A well-defined architecture is crucial for ensuring a scalable, performant, and maintainable integration. We'll explore the high-level system overview, key component interactions, and essential considerations for security and performance.

Understanding these principles will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent sections, where we delve into the specifics of data ingestion and storefront integration. By adhering to these guidelines, you can build a robust and efficient solution that leverages the strengths of both Fredhopper and SFCC.

## High-Level Architecture Overview
The following diagram shows a high-level typical architecture deployment of Fredhopper & SFCC. While each customer's implementation will vary, this can be used as a general starting point for implementation discussion.

## Key Components and Interactions

The follow is a description of each component shown on the High-Level Architecture Diagram (above).
| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Fredhopper Access Service (FAS)** | The core Fredhopper service platform. |
| **Query API** | The API for interacting with Fredhopper for product or navigation queries, returning XML or JSON. |
| **Suggest** | The API for retrieving search suggestions, returning JSON. |
| **Data APIs** | The pipeline for providing Fredhopper with product updates, in batch or incremental forms. Data is sent to these APIs to keep product data current within Fredhopper. |
| **FAS Reporting** | Customer usage data reporting |
| **p13n** | Realtime Personalization usage data tracker. Customer interaction is notified here to effect realtime updates on product data returned by FAS. |
| **Salesforce Commerce Cloud** | Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) is a cloud-based platform that helps businesses sell products and services online. In this diagram, SFCC drives all sales channels within the Retailer Web. |
| **Retailer Data** | Core portions of the customer experience architecture that drive e-commerce back-office functions. |
| **3rd Party Data Suppliers** | Any relevant 3rd party data that may be integrated to impact the responses from Fredhopper. |

## Scalability and Performance Considerations
When integrating Fredhopper with Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC), scalability and performance are paramount to ensure a seamless customer experience, especially during peak traffic periods. Here's a breakdown of critical considerations:

### Data Ingestion Optimization
- **Incremental Updates:** Use incremental updates to send individual product changes throughout the day. This significantly reduces the processing load and update time and ensures product data is current.
- **Batch Processing:** Use batch processing for full data ingestion once a day to send all product data to minimize the impact on system resources.
- **Efficient Data Transformation:** Optimize data transformation scripts for performance. Avoid unnecessary data manipulations and use efficient algorithms.
- **API Throttling and Rate Limiting:** Understand and respect API rate limits from SFCC. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to handle temporary API issues.

### Query Performance
- **Caching:** Implement robust caching strategies at various levels (e.g., CDN, application server, client-side).
- **Query Optimization:** Optimize Fredhopper query configurations for performance. Utilize single queries per page, display fields and filters to minimize query execution time.
- **Asynchronous Queries:** For complex queries or heavy traffic, consider using asynchronous query processing to prevent blocking the main application thread.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute Fredhopper query load across multiple IPs or instances to prevent overload and ensure high availability.
- **Proper Indexing:** Ensure your Fredhopper indexes are properly configured. Index only the necessary attributes.

### Infrastructure and Resource Management
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Design your infrastructure to scale horizontally to handle increasing traffic and data volume.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring of system resources (CPU, memory, network) to identify bottlenecks and performance issues.
- **Database Optimization:** Optimize database performance through indexing, query optimization, and proper resource allocation.
- **CDN Usage:** Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static assets and reduce latency for storefront requests.

**Note:** Does not apply to the Fredhopper platform as this is offered as a SaaS based solution and is full managed by Crownpeak.

### Code Optimization
- **Efficient Code:** Write efficient code for storefront integration and data processing. Minimize unnecessary network requests and data transfers.
- **Profiling and Performance Testing:** Regularly profile your code and conduct performance testing to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
- **Minimize Payload Size:** Reduce the size of data payloads transferred between SFCC, Fredhopper, and the storefront.

### Fredhopper Specific Considerations
- **Relevance Tuning:** Fine-tune search index configuration and ranking cocktails within Fredhopper to ensure accurate and relevant search results
- **Facet Optimization:** Optimize facet configurations to ensure effective queries and navigation, and removal of redundant facets.

By carefully considering these scalability and performance aspects, you can build a robust and efficient Fredhopper and SFCC integration that delivers a superior customer experience.

## Security Best Practices
Security is a critical consideration when integrating Fredhopper with Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC). Protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure communication is essential for maintaining customer trust and preventing security breaches. Here's a breakdown of key security best practices:

### API Security
- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict API access to authorized users and applications.
  - Avoid embedding API keys or user credentials directly in client-side code.
- **HTTPS Encryption:**
  - Ensure all API communication between SFCC, Fredhopper, and the storefront is conducted over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **API Rate Limiting:**
  - Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
  - Sanitize all API inputs, and outputs to prevent injection attacks.

### Data Security
- **Data Minimization:**
  - Only transfer and store the data necessary for search and navigation functionality.
  - Avoid storing sensitive personal information (SPI).
- **Regular Security Audits:**
  - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- **Data Masking:**
  - Mask sensitive data inside of logs, or during development, and testing.

### Storefront Security
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection:**
  - Sanitize all user inputs and outputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**
  - Implement CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized requests.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  - Use CSP to restrict the resources that the browser can load, mitigating the risk of XSS and other attacks.
- **Secure Cookies:**
  - Use secure and HTTP-only cookies to protect session information.
- **Regular Security Updates:**
  - Keep all software components up to date with the latest security patches.

### SFCC Specific Security
- **OCAPI Security:**
  - Follow Salesforce best practices for OCAPI security.
- **SFCC Roles and Permissions:**
  - Utilize SFCC roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.

By implementing these security best practices, you can create a secure and reliable Fredhopper and SFCC integration that protects sensitive data and maintains customer trust.
